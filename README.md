# 🔶 Request ☺️
🔸 please anyone start building this project.
We should make an Android app 💭 which has all the features 🔥 of Visual Studio Code.😲 Because we cannot keep the laptop with us all the time.😭I researched a lot of apps on Google play store, but there is no such app in the visual studio code like features.☹️
